# Beginner - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project - Titanic Analysis

This is a practice project where I performed basic **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

# Project Overview

- Handled missing values in Age and Embarked columns
- Dropped duplicate rows
- Filtered passengers based on conditions (e.g., first class)
- Created visualizations such as:
  - Survival rate by class
  - Age distribution
  - Survival by gender
  - Survivors by embarkation point
  - Fare distribution by class
  - Correlation heatmap

# Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
